This plugin **completely** bypasses the death screen in Hytale, similar to Minecraft's *doImmediateRespawn* gamerule.

Instead of immediately dismissing the vanilla death screen (which in our testing causes the death screen to appear for a
frame after dying), this plugin shows an invisible UI and immediately dismisses that instead, which means you should
never see the death screen!

**THIS PLUGIN MIGHT NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER PLUGINS**, so report any issues with plugin compatibility
